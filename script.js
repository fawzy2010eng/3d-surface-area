//we have an array of squares whare the coordinates of the array is it's index in the array and the height is the value
//we loop over every square adding the upper and the lower area then loop _for every squres_ through it's four sides 
//if there's no square on the nth direction or the height is greater then this area is 0
//we get the sum of the areas for every square theb return the sum of the all squares
